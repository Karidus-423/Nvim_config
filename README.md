### "The lazy one works twice."/"El harag√°n trabaja doble." -- My Parents
I wanted to know more about my text editor, be better at using my tools and once I understood them I was able to know why something worked or didn't work.
Neovim helped me greatly to understand my development enviroment and made me realize that there are tools out there that just work and don't need to have 
all the bells and whistle in the world to be powerful.
